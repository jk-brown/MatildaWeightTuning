# Goal

Plot results in ternary plot that shows the error associated with different numerical combinations of criteria weights. 


# Plots 

Testing out ternary plot code:
```{r}
# Create the ternary plot with error as color
ggtern(data = plotting_list$`SSP1-1.9`, aes(x = temp_wt, y = CO2_wt, z = ocean_uptake_wt, color = median_error)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, shape = 15) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  theme_showarrows() +
  theme_hidetitles() +
  xlab("Temperature Weight") +
  ylab("CO2 Weight") +
  zlab("Ocean C Uptake Weight") +
  labs(
    title = "Error of central value",
    color = "Percent Error"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~term_length)

ggsave("example_figure.png", 
       device = "png")
