# Goal

Plot results in ternary plot that shows the error associated with different numerical combinations of criteria weights. 


# Plots 

Testing out ternary plot code:
```{r}
# Create the ternary plot with error as color
ggtern(data = plot_df, aes(x = temp_wt, y = co2_wt, z = ocean_uptake_wt, color = upper_error.percentage_error)) +
  geom_point(size = 10, shape = 15) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Error of Warming Values ",
    x = "Temperature Weight",
    y = "CO2 Weight",
    z = "Ocean C Uptake Weight",
    color = "Percent Error"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~scenario)

```
